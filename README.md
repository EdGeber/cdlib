``NClib`` provides implementations of several community discovery algorithms.
Moreover, it implements a wide set of partition evaluation measures as well as predefined visualization facilities.

``NClib`` is designed around the ``networkx`` python library: however, when needed, it takes care to authomatically convert (from and to) ``igraph`` object so to provide an abstraction on specific algorithm implementations to the final user.

## Installation

To install the library just download (or clone) the current project and copy the ndlib folder in the root of your application.

Alternatively use pip:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/GiulioRossetti/nclib
```
