    walktrap is an approach based on random walks.
    The general idea is that if you perform random walks on the graph, then the walks are more likely to stay within the same community because there are only a few edges that lead outside a given community. Walktrap runs short random walks and uses the results of these random walks to merge separate communities in a bottom-up manner.
